/**
 * Builder generating classes.
 * <p>
 * The {@code Facade} class contains factory methods for the generation of
 * different kinds of builder classes. It configures the
 * <p>
 * {@code BuilderGenerator} class to produce builder classes for given product
 * classes.
 * <p>
 * The {@code Sorter} class separates the generation process from the ordering
 * of the class members according to the java coding guide lines from sun.
 * <p>
 * The {@code Facade} classes also provides methods to decide if a product
 * candidate class actualy needs a builder class.
 * <p>
 * The java classes used in the package interface are {@code CompilationUnit}
 * objects generated with the {@code JavaParser} package.
